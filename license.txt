This repository and all associated materials (the “Project”) are private, proprietary, and confidential.
The Project is not open source.

Access to the Project does not imply any public, open, or unrestricted licence.

“Contributor” means any individual or entity that submits code, documentation, or other materials to the Project.

“Contribution” means any original work submitted by a Contributor for inclusion in the Project.

“Authorised Users” means Contributors and others explicitly granted access by the Maintainer.

3. Ownership of Contributions

Unless otherwise agreed in writing:

Each Contributor retains copyright in their own Contributions.

By submitting a Contribution, the Contributor grants the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use, modify, reproduce, and distribute the Contribution as part of the Project.

No ownership rights are transferred by this licence.

4. Licence to Use the Project

Subject to compliance with this licence, Authorised Users are granted a limited, non-transferable right to:

Unless explicitly authorised in writing by the Maintainer, Authorised Users must not:

redistribute the Project or any part of it outside this repository;

publish the Project or Contributions in other repositories or products;

sublicense, sell, or transfer the Project;

use the Project in unrelated projects where the Authorised Users are not directly involved in the outcomes.

Access to the Project does not grant rights for general reuse, reuse by third parties, or reuse in unrelated commercial or non-commercial activities.

6. Third-Party Rights and Contributions

Contributors represent that their Contributions are original and do not knowingly infringe the rights of any third party.

Where Contributions include third-party material, the Contributor must clearly identify any applicable licence or usage restrictions.

7. No Warranty

The Project is provided “as is”, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Upon termination, continued use, copying, or distribution of the Project is prohibited.
