understanding corporate finance concepts relevant to macro and event-driven trading. Includes detailed walkthroughs of
valuation models and deal structuring.

### Options As A Strategic Investment (Lawrence G. McMillan) — 1980

A comprehensive reference on options strategies, pricing considerations, and practical trade setups for income, hedging,
and speculation. McMillan's book is a long-standing resource for options traders covering strategy mechanics and risk
management.

### Time Series Analysis Forecasting And Control (Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, Ljung) — 1970

A foundational textbook on time series analysis introducing ARIMA modeling, identification, estimation, and diagnostic
checking; essential for classical forecasting techniques used in finance. The book established methodologies still used
in econometrics and signal processing.

### Trading Systems: New Approach To Portfolio Optimisation (Tomasini & Jaekle) — 2009

Combines trading system design with portfolio optimization techniques, presenting approaches to combine multiple

technological infrastructure. Aldridge discusses both strategy classes and the operational challenges of running HFT
systems.
