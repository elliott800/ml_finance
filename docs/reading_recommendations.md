a long-standing resource for options traders, covering strategy mechanics and
risk management.

### Time Series Analysis: Forecasting And Control — 1970

A foundational textbook on time series analysis introducing ARIMA modeling,
identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking. Essential for classical
forecasting techniques used in finance. The book established methodologies
still used in econometrics and signal processing.

### Trading Systems: New Approach To Portfolio Optimisation — 2009
