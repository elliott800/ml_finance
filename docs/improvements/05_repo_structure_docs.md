# Task: 5 - Repo Structure & Documentation (Medium)

## Goal

Separate research/educational artifacts from production code, and document safe
development workflows.

## Tasks

- Move research notebooks & experiments

  - Create a `notes/` or `recipes/` directory at the repo root and move notebooks,
    ad-hoc scripts, and experimental files there.

- Root `README.md`

  - Ensure `README.md` at the repo root contains a clear safety warning about
    live trading and links to `docs/improvements.md`.

- CONTRIBUTING & development docs

  - Maintain `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions for proposing changes, running
    tests, and PR expectations for live-trading code.

- Docs index

  - Keep `docs/improvements.md` as the canonical index and checklist for
    safety-related tasks.

## Priority

Medium
Estimated effort: 2–4 hours
Owner: Maintainer / docs contributor

## Validation

- `README.md` exists at repo root and contains the safety warning and links to
  documentation.

## Notes

- Moving files should be non-destructive; do not delete originals without team
  consent.
